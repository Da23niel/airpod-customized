                                The Apple-designed 
                                H2 chip is the force behind the advanced audio performance of AirPods Pro, 
                                working with the driver and amplifier to create crisp, high-definition sound.  
                                It uses computational algorithms to deliver noise cancellation,<span class="green">superior three-dimensional sound, 
                                and efficient battery life — all at once.</span> 
                
                                The chip uses powerful adaptation algorithms to process sound more quickly, 
                                tuning audio at the precise moment you hear it. Every detail is rendered for your specific ear
                                shape, immersing you in higher-fidelity sound.
                                An inward-facing microphone works with voice enhancement algorithms
                                to recognize and articulate your voice, so your phone and video calls
                                always sound completely natural.

                                A custom-built driver and amplifier work with the H2 chip to provide lower d
                                istortion during playback, so you'll hear deeper bass and crisper highs — across all volume
                                levels.

                        AirPods Pro will pair with Apple Vision Pro (available early next year in the U.S.)
