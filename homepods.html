                            The HomePod is a smart speaker developed by Apple Inc. 
                            Designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service,
                            the HomePod incorporates beamforming and eight speakers and
                            is sold in two colors: white and space gray.

                            If you're enjoying music or a podcast and have to head out,
                             you can continue to listen on your iPhone without missing a beat.
                              Hand it off simply by bringing your iPhone close to HomePod mini.
                               You'll experience the feeling of your iPhone and HomePod mini connecting 
                               virtually as the sound transfers.3
                               Hand off music and podcasts between HomePod mini and iPhone
                               Personalized listening suggestions will also automatically appear on your 
                               iPhone when you hold it next to HomePod mini. You'll have instant control at your
                                fingertips without having to unlock your iPhone.4
                               
                               Intelligent assistant
                               Siri does everything like there's nothing to it.
                               
                               Siri is your do-it-all intelligent assistant that puts HomePod mini at
                                the center of your family's activities. And with multiple HomePod mini speakers
                                 around the house, it's easy to call on Siri from anywhere — with either a “Hey Siri” or
                                  now just “Siri”. HomePod mini and Siri can do even more with your iPhone and AirPlay. 
                                  Simply start an AirPlay session from your iPhone, or ask HomePod mini to play audio 
                                  from apps on your iPhone using just your voice.5
